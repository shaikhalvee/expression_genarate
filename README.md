# Expression Genaration using Genetic algorithm

## Synopsis
Its an expression genaration program mainly. There are 2 file, the "auto" one automatically creates input (using uniform random
distribution) and the "inp" one takes input from user and puts output accordingly.

## What is used
A number is given, number of operators are given. Using this number of operators the program tries to create expression to evaluate
the number. Genetic mutation and crossover algorithm is used here.
Python 3 is used to implement it.

## Problem Description
The problem description was provided to us in the pdf here by teachers. If anyone sees the files, are requested to see the pdf files first. Then you will have a clear understanding what we have implemented here.
