# Expression Genaration using Genetic algorithm

## Description
Its an expression genaration program mainly. There are 2 file, the "auto" one automatically creates input (using uniform random
distribution) and the "inp" one takes input from user and puts output accordingly.

## What is used
A number is given, number of operators are given. Using this number of operators the program tries to create expression to evaluate
the number. Genetic mutation and crossover algorithm is used here.
